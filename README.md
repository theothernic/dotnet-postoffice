## What is this?
This is a project to help with dealing with email -- mass communications that don't really belong in my personal inbox. I'm also not looking to try and run an email server setup, either -- there's services for that!

This software attempts to download email files that have been captured through Amazon SES and saved to Amazon S3 as a file, and put them in a database of some kind for future grepping and schlepping.
